# dart_sdl

This package wraps the [SDL](https://wiki.libsdl.org/) package.

I have been implementing functions as I needed them. As such, this library is
not complete. I of course welcome
[issues](https://github.com/chrisnorman7/dart_sdl/issues/new).

## Breaking changes

As of version 0.6.0, the API has massively changed due to code generation used to create `lib/src/enumerations.dart`.

Also, though there used to be an exhaustive list of what had been bound, and what was left to do in this file, it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain such a list, so I'm shifting such docs to the code.
